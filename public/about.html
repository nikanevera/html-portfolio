<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nika and I am a newbie in Developers world. I have started my studies just recently (18/10/23) but I'm already in love with coding. 
  Till today's date (23/10/23) I have only learnt HTML - that's why this page is so simple. However, I have CSS and Javascript and I'm looking 
  forward to expand my knowledge and create beautiful web-pages. </p>

<p>In my free time I like singing, playing guitar, reading books. I consider myself a psychology enthusiast - I love learning new things about 
  people's inner world. Being a good listener I am able to provide a person with comfort and a great piece of advise.</p>

<p>I have bachelor's degree in tourism, however, I have never worked in this sphere - hotels and travel agencies have not been attractive to me.
   My career path was mostly laying in the customer support field which made me depressed as I always felt I'm able to do more than this with my
    life. That is the reason why I decided to learn Front-end development. It is a creative and interesting field where I can use my potential 
    to fulest. </p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my first ever web page :) </p>
